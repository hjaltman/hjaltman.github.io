<h1>Which graphs are winnable in Snake?</h1>

(<b>Updated</b> May 9th, 2019; see bottom for what was corrected)<p>

Let's consider the game of Snake; except instead of playing it on a grid, we're
going to play it on an arbitrary finite [simple] graph.  We assume the snake
starts at length 1 -- the game begins by the "computer" (who acts adversarially)
picking a starting spot for the snake and a starting spot for the fruit.  When
the snake consumes the fruit (and thereby grows by 1), the computer picks a new
spot for the fruit, which cannot be somewhere currently covered by the snake.
We'll say the player wins if the snake covers the whole graph.  If the game goes
on infinitely, I guess that's a draw, but we'll give it to the computer.<p>

So the general question then is, for which graphs can the player always win?
(Hence why I said draws go to the computer.)  Now this question is not
necessarily that concrete; there might not be any nice characterization.  I have
bunch of notes about necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for this,
but I'm not going to list them all here.<p>

(Here are some obvious ones -- if a spanning subgraph of a graph is winnable,
then so is the whole thing; any cycle is winnable, so so is any graph with a
Hamilton cycle; in order to be winnable, a graph must have a Hamilton path.  But
like I said, I'm not going to put all my notes here.)<p>

So -- you'll notice I didn't give a totally formal specification of the rules
above, and there's a reason for that.  When you formalize the rules, you realize
there's the question: Should a snake of length 2 be allowed to turn around?  As
in, move its head to the current location of the tail.  If you write the rules
in the obvious manner, this is entirely legal, but it seems kind of unintuitive.
So we can have two variants of the game: The <i>weak</i> game, where this is
allowed; and the <i>strong</i> game, where it is not.  (Note that you could
consider graphs with multiple edges, and say that then in the strong game you're
allowed to turn around if there's a double edge; but I'm restricting to simple
graphs for reasons you'll see shortly.)<p>

There is at least one graph that is weakly winnable but not strongly winnable,
namely, a path of length 3.  So, <b>question number one</b>: Are there any other
such graphs?  I suspect the answer is no but have been unable to prove it.
Hence the restriction to simple graphs -- if I'm right, then unless the
"underlying simple graph" is P<sub>3</sub>, adding multiple edges simply won't
affect anything.  (And it's easy to see how it affects P<sub>3</sub>.)<p>

But let's put that aside and return to the question of which graphs are
winnable more generally.  Above I wrote that this question might be too broad
to answer.  But actually it's possible -- I won't say likely, but possible --
that it might have a not-too-complicated answer.<p>

Let's reformulate the question first.  If a graph has a spanning subgraph which
is winnable, then the graph is winnable.  Hence, rather than focusing on all
winnable graphs, let's focus just on <i>minimal</i> winnables -- ones where
deleting any edge renders the graph unwinnable.  (Note: For the rest of this,
I'm going to assume the strong game unless I say otherwise.)  Characterizing
these would characterize all winnable graphs, as a graph is winnable iff it
contains some minimal winnable.<p>

Then so far I've only managed to find a few types of minimal winnable graphs!
And, more generally, every winnable graph I know of contains one of these as a
spanning subgraph.  There are of course the trivial ones -- the zero-vertex
graph, the one-vertex graph, the path P<sub>2</sub>.  But the interesting ones
are the following:
<ol>
<li>For n&ge;3, the cycle C<sub>n</sub>.  (In the weak game, we should restrict
to n&ge;4, as there C<sub>3</sub> is not minimal.)
<li>For n&ge;3, two copies of K<sub>n</sub> joined at a vertex.  (In the weak
game, we should instead say n&ge;2, as n=2 yields the path P<sub>3</sub>.)
<li>For 1&le;i&le;j&le;k, define &Theta;<sub>i,j,k</sub> to be the graph
consisting of two vertices and three paths between them, with i, j, and k
vertices in the interior of the three paths (respectively).  Then
&Theta;<sub>1,1,k</sub> and &Theta;<sub>2,2,k</sub>
are examples of minimal winnable graphs.
</ol><p>

So, <b>question number two</b>: Could this possibly be all of them?  It seems
unlikely, but it might just be possible.  I have in fact verified that these are
all of them up to 7 vertices, so any counterexample will have to be at least 8
vertices, unless I've messed up.<p>

<hr>

Corrections: An earlier version of this page erroneously claimed that
&Theta;<sub>1,2,k</sub> is winnable.  It also asked, as question number two,
whether a subdivision of an unwinnable graph is also unwinnable; this question
is now answered in the negative.  Finally, it also claimed that I had checked
all graphs of up to 8 vertices, but it turns out the method I used is only valid
up to 7 vertices.
