<h1>Notes on a Fibonacci tree</h1>

So Beren Gunsolus came up with this nifty rule for generating a tree that is
full of Fibonacci numbers, he and I and some others (Astra Kolomatskaia, <a
href="https://twitter.com/orellanin">Ophelia</a>, Emma C) figured out what's
going on with it, and now I want to tell you about it.<a
href="#paper"><sup>1</sup></a><p>

Beren defined the tree iteratively.  The root is 1.  Then, at each step, we find
the smallest number in the tree that does not have any children<a
href="#nodups"><sup>2</sup></a>, and give it two children; the left child is the
smallest not yet in the tree, and the right child is the sum of the parent and
the left child.<p>

Here's a partial picture of what it looks like, having given children to every
number up to 21:
<pre>                                         1
                         /---------------+-----------------\
                         |                                 |
               /---------2-------\                 /-------3-------\
               |                 |                 |               |
        /------4---\         /---6---\         /---5---\       /---8---\

  /-12\ /-19\ /18\  29  /17\  27 26   42   /15\ 24  23  37  22  35  34  55

If you stare at this a while, you'll likely notice some patterns, like the
Fibonacci numbers going down the right-hand side, or the Fibonacci numbers
minus one going down the left hand side, or any of the many other ways that
Fibonacci numbers appear in the tree.<a href="#fib"><sup>3</sup></a>  You may
also notice some relations that hold but aren't obvious from the original
construction; like, for instance, not only does the parent plus the left child
equal the right child, but also, the left child plus the right child equals the
left child <i>of</i> the right child.<a href="#relations"><sup>4</sup></a><p>

<h2>So what is this tree?</h2>

So, is there some nice description of the tree that explains all of this, that
isn't based on this iterative building rule?  Yes!

You've probably heard of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem">Zeckendorf
representation</a>, which is like "base Fibonacci" (for the purposes of
Zeckendorf the Fibonacci sequence starts 1, 2, 3, 5,...), with the digits being
0 and 1, and the restriction being that there can never be two conseuctive ones.
Well it turns out there's such a thing as <i>dual Zeckendorf</i>, which is the
same thing, except that instead the restriction is that you can't have
consecutive zeroes (the implicit 0's before the initial 1 don't count).<a
href="#bz"><sup>5</sup></a><p>

It turns out that dual Zeckendorf is the key to Beren's tree, if we just
subtract 1 from each number (so now 0 is the root).  If we subtract 1 from each
number, then the root is the empty string, taking the left child corresponds to
appending 1, and taking the right child corresponds to appending 10.  Every
legal dual Zeckendorf representation can be made uniquely in this way, so the
tree contains each whole number exactly once, as we saw earlier.<p>

<h3>Proof of the dual Zeckendorf description</h3>

To prove this<a href="#credit"><sup>7</sup></a>, let's divide positive integers
into "cold" numbers, that end with a 1 in dual Zeckendorf, and "hot" numbers,
that end with a 0 (the number 0 is neither).  We're going to work in the
adjusted tree, which is going to obey the rule R'(n)=n+L'(n)+1 (here L', R'
denote the adjusted operations for this adjusted tree).  Now, we'll group hot
and cold numbers into pairs, where a cold number m will be paired with the hot
number m:0, the colon denoting concatenation.  So in each pair, the cold number
is always smaller.<p>

So, assume as an inductive hypothesis that the theorem is true for all numbers
already in the tree; this means that cold and hot numbers have been added in
pairs.  Then, when we go to process a number n, and we want to determine L'(n),
well, L'(n) cannot be hot, because each excluded hot number has a smaller cold
number that is also excluded.  So L'(n) must be cold, and the smallest excluded
cold number is (applying the inductive hypothesis) n:1.  Then to determine R'(n)
we simply add n, L'(n), and 1, and this addition yields n:10.  This proves the
claim.<p>

Now this new description of the tree may strike you as obviously related to some
other trees, or cause you to ask hey what about such-and-such a natural-seeming
variant, but, we'll get to variants down below.  First, let's give a third
description of the tree!<p>

<h3>Another description, this one parity-based</h3>

But there's yet another description of Beren's tree, one based on ordinary
Zeckendorf and not dual Zeckendorf, and one that doesn't require adjusting the
tree by subtracting one from everything.<p>

Write the original tree in ordinary Zeckendorf.  The root is 1.  Then, to get
the children of a given node, if the node ends in an even number of zeroes, then
the left child appends 0 and the right child appends 00.  While if the node ends
in an odd number of zeroes, then the left child appends 1, while the right child
appends 01.<p>

I know of two ways to prove this equivalence.  The first is to once again adapt
Ophelia's cold/hot argument to this new description, proving its equivalence
with Beren's original description.  This adaptation is straightforward and I
won't belabor it.<p>

The second is to directly prove its equivalence with the dual Zeckendorf
description; I'm going to relegate that one to the footnotes. <a
href="#parity"><sup>8</sup></a><p>

<h2>The reading sequence and its inverse</h2>

Now let's get to the really good stuff.<p>

Let's say we read across the rows of the tree, in order, from left to right.  If
we do this, we get the sequence<p>

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 11, 10, 16, 9, 14, 13, 21...<p>

Beren plugged this into OEIS and found that it's <a
href="https://oeis.org/A232560">A232560</a>, which is defined as the inverse
permutation of <a href="https://oeis.org/A232559">A232559</a>, which is in turn
obtained from reading across a <i>different</i> tree (there's a picture of it at
the link).

This other tree is a tree of doubling or adding 1.  It has 1 as the root, and
each node has two children; for the left child you add 1, for the right child
you double.  Well, except that actually not every node has two children -- if we
did that, the tree would be full of duplicates, so, we only allow adding 1 to
numbers that are even.  Odd numbers only get a single child.<p>

From this description, this second tree doesn't seem to have anything to do with
Fibonacci numbers!  Why would it be somehow inverse to the first tree?<p>

That's not the only seemingly odd thing here either.  The second tree isn't even
a binary tree.  If the trees had the same shape, then we could regard these two
permutations not as being on the linearly-ordered natural numbers, but rather on
the nodes of the unlabeled tree of that shape, and show that the permutations
were inverse that way, and then we'd never have to involve this whole "reading
sequence" business.  But since they're not the same shape, that means that in
our two reading order sequences, the row boundaries are falling in different
places.  And yet they're inverse to each other!<p>

Well, it turns out that there's a nice explanation, and that the shape of the
tree is actually not a problem but rather the solution.  You see, the tree that
we started with was a tree based on Fibonacci numbers and (dual) Zeckendorf
representation, but in shape it was a binary tree.  The second tree is based on
binary representation, but its shape is Fibonacci!<p>

If you actually draw the second tree, you'll see the lengths of the rows are
Fibonacci.  Of course they are; it's doing the whole Fibonacci rabbit thing.
Only even-valued nodes (adult rabbits) can have two children, with odd-valued
nodes (juvenile rabbits) having only one.<p>

So, we have a Fibonacci binary tree, and a binary Fiboncci tree.  The inverse
relation makes a bit more sense now, no?<p>

<h3>Switching from binary to bijective binary</h3>

To actually prove it, we'll want to start by subtracing 1 from each number in
both trees, so the roots are now 0 rather than 1.  These are the versions of the
trees we'll work with.  As you know, when you do this to Beren's tree, you get
the dual Zeckendorf tree; 0 is the root (empty string), left child means
appending 1, right child means appending 0.<p>

What about our other tree?  Well, if we <i>don't</i> subtract 1, then it's a
tree of binary representations; 1 is the root; even numbers have two children,
with the left child corresponding to changing the final 0 to a 1, and the right
child corresponding to appending 0; and odd numbers have one child,
corresponding to appending 0.<p>

OK, but what if we do subtract 1?  Well, then it's a tree of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration">bijective</a> binary
representations!  The doubling operation becomes double-and-increment.  So now 0
(the empty string) is the root; it's odd numbers that have two children, with
the left child meaning you change the final 1 to a 2, and the right child
meaning you append a 1; and even numbers have only one child, corresponding to
appending a 1.<p>

<h3>Proof core of the inverse relation</h3>

Anyway, having made the adjustments above, time to start the work of the proof.
In order to see that these trees have inverse reading permutations, I want to
introduce two auxiliary trees.  We have a Fibonacci binary tree and a binary
Fibonacci tree, but for comaprison, I'm going to introduce a binary binary tree
and a Fibonacci Fibonacci tree.<p>

That is to say -- consider the binary tree that, when read across, simply yields
0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  This, if we look at it in bijective binary, can be described
as a tree with root 0 (the empty string), where the left child is append a 1,
and the right child is append a 2.<p>

We can do the same thing on the other side; we can take a tree as the same shape
as our Fibonacci-shaped tree of bijective binary numbers, but one whose reading
sequence is simply 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  This similarly has a natural interpretation
in terms of dual Zeckendorf; left children mean append a zero, right (or only)
children mean you append a 1.  Only numbers that are a 1-child can have a
0-child.<a href="#lex"><sup>10</sup></a><p>

So: Let us consider the permutation that takes our binary binary tree (whose
reading sequence is just the whole numbers) to our Fibonacci (dual-Zeckendorf)
binary tree (which has the same shape).  What does it do to the number at any
given spot?  Well, what you do to the number is, you write the number in
bijective binary; then you change each 2 to a 10 while leaving each 1 as a 1;
then you interpret the string as dual Zeckendorf.  So that's our permutation one
way.<p>

Now, we consider the permutation that takes our Fibonacci Fibonacci tree (whose
reading sequence is just the whole numbers) to our binary Fibonacci tree (which
has the same shape).  What does this do to the number at any given spot?  Well,
you write the number in bijective binary; then, starting with the empty string,
you interpret each 1 as an "append 1" and each 0 as a "change the final 1 to a
2" (because a 0-child must have a parent that is a 1-child, this is
well-defined); then you interpret the string as bijective binary.  That's our
permutation the other way.<p>

And, well, those two operations are inverse to each other, so there you go!
Where did we use the reading order?  How did we deal with the fact that the two
trees are different shapes?  By setting up two auxiliary trees which, although
they had different shapes from each other, had identical reading sequences.
Basically we had a chain of four trees, FB-BB-FF-BF, where the pairs FB-BB and
FF-BF have the same shape, while the pairs BB-FF have the same reading
sequence.<p>

<h2>Variants and relations among them</h2>

<h3>Ordinary Zeckendorf and ordinary binary</h3>

Now, you may have noticed here that we used <i>dual</i> Zeckendorf and
<i>bijective</i> binary, with roots starting from 0.  But what if we had used
<i>ordinary</i> Zeckendorf, with root starting from 1?  Where the left child
meant "append 0" and the right child meant "append 01"?  Well, in that case, the
same argument as above implies that our corresponding "inverse" tree would be a
tree based on <i>ordinary</i> binary, with 1 as the root... a tree that is
<i>almost</i> the same as our original double-or-increment tree, before we
subtracted 1 from everything.  The only difference?  It'd be flipped
left-to-right.  That tree had the left child meaning "change the final 0 to a 1"
(when there were two children) and the right child meaning "append a 0"; here it
would be the other way around.<p>

<h3>Another parity-based tree</h3>

But there's more!  What if we took this ordinary Zeckendorf tree, and subtracted
1 from everything?  Well, then, obviously, the reading permutation would be
inverse to that of our flipped tree but with 1 subtracted from everything.  The
interesting part is that this tree has an alternate characterization!<p>

Namely, this new tree, if we write it in dual Zeckendorf, follows a parity rule
like we saw earlier!  The root is 0 (the empty string), and if a node ends in an
even number of ones, then the left child appends 1 and the right child appends
11; while if the node ends in an odd number of ones, then the left child
appends 0, while the right child appends 10.<p>

One can prove this using an analogue of the parity proof from earlier; it's
exactly analogous, so I won't bother writing it out.<a
href="#append1"><sup>11</sup></a><p>

<h3>Now let's double everything</h3>

OK, but what if we took our Zeckendorf and dual-Zeckendorf-based trees and
flipped those?  Obviously, the +1/-1 relations between them would still hold.
But would we once again get binary-based trees giving the inverse reading
permutation?<p>

Yes!  I won't bother proving it because again it's the same as above, but we'd
once again get trees based on binary or bijective binary, only now, we'd be
<i>decrementing</i> instead of incrementing.<p>

That is to say, for the trees based on ordinary binary, your options would be to
append a 1, or, if the number ends with a 1, to change the final 1 to a 0; and
for bijective binary, you could append a 2, or change the final 2 (if there is
one) to a 1.<p>

<h3>Summary with diagram of relations</h3>

To summarize, here's a list of the (nontrivial) involved trees and the relations
between them.<p>

Each tree I'll notate by two letters.  The first letter will be one of:
<ul>
<li> Z, for trees based on Zeckendorf representation
<li> D, for trees based on dual Zeckendorf
<li> B, for trees based on binary representation
<li> b, for trees based on binary reprsentation but with decrements
<li> J, for trees based on bijective binary
<li> j, for trees based on bijective binary but with decrements
</ul>

If the first letter is Z or D, the second letter will be one of:
<ul>
<li> B, for binary trees in forward order (right child is larger)
<li> b, for binary trees in reverse order (left child is larger)
<li> P, for parity-based binary trees in forward order
<li> p, for parity-based binary trees in reverse order
</ul>

If the first letter is B or J, the second letter will be one of:
<ul>
<li> D, for trees in forward order
<li> Z, for trees in reverse order
</ul>

(This last notation may seem strange, but -- considering that the larger number
is the one where a digit is appended rather than altered -- forward order vs
reverse order determines whether the tree is shaped in such a way that position
in the tree corresponds to Zeckendorf representation (reverse order) or dual
Zeckendorf (forward order).)<p>

Trees beginning with Z, B, or b will use 1 as the root, while trees beginning
with D, J, or j will use 0 (the empty string) as the root.  For clarity, I'll
put the root in brackets after the name of the tree.<p>

Beren's original tree is ZP[1].<p>

We then get the following diagram of relations among the trees:
<pre>               inverse        flip          inverse
        jD[0] -------- Db[0] ------ DB[0] ---------- JD[0]

    |/+1  inverse     /+1  flip  +1/     inverse   |/+1
   bZ[1] --------- Zb[1] ------ ZB[1] ---------- BZ[1]</pre><p>

By the way, you may be wondering, what about bijective Zeckendorf?
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to fit nicely into the picture above.<p>

<h2>Back to the original characterization: Handling the variants</h2>

Can we characterize some of these variants in the same way we originally
generated Beren's tree?  Yes, we can!<p>

Beren's tree ZP uses 1 as the root and obeys n+L(n)=R(n).  When you subtract 1
to get the tree DB, it uses 0 as the root and obeys n+L(n)+1=R(n).  (In this
section I'll just use L(n) and R(n) to mean the left and right child in the tree
under discussion, not necessarily the original tree ZP.)<p>

Let's generalize this.  For c&ge;1, we'll define T<sub>c,0</sub>, or just
T<sub>c</sub>, to be the 0-rooted tree, generated like Beren's tree but with the
law n+L(n)+c=R(n).  We'll also define T<sub>c,1</sub> to be the 1-rooted tree
defined analogously but with n+L(n)+(c-1)=R(n).  We subtract 1 from the
contstant so that T<sub>c,1</sub> is equal to T<sub>c,0</sub> with 1 added to
each node.<p>

Then, as noted above, T<sub>1,0</sub>=DB, and T<sub>1,1</sub>=ZP.  But the trees
T<sub>2,0</sub> and T<sub>2,1</sub> are also trees that were discussed above!
Namely, T<sub>2,1</sub>=ZB.  One can prove this using the usual hot/cold-style
argument.  This means that T<sub>2,0</sub>=DP.  One can prove this either by
noting that T<sub>2,0</sub>=T<sub>2,1</sub>-1=ZB-1=DP, or one can again prove it
hot/cold style.  The latter approach, I suppose, would also function as an
alternate proof that DP=ZP-1.<p>

Let's make this into a table:

<ul>
<li> T<sub>1,0</sub> = DB
<li> T<sub>1,1</sub> = T<sub>1,0</sub>+1 = ZP
<li> T<sub>2,0</sub> = DP
<li> T<sub>2,1</sub> = T<sub>2,0</sub>+1 = ZB
</ul>

OK, but what about T<sub>3</sub> and up?  (From here on out I'm just going to
focus on the 0-rooted version.)

<h3>Fiddling with the constants a little</h3>

This is where things really start to get hairy.  For T<sub>3</sub> I
actually have a description, although it's a little funky.  Beyond that, though,
I simply don't have any good answer.  (Note that it's T<sub>3,0</sub> and not
T<sub>3,1</sub> that admit this nice description... this is why I'm ignoring the
1-rooted trees in this section.)<p>

We can generate the tree T<sub>3</sub> as follows.  Write each number in dual
Zeckendorf.  The root is 0, which we will write as 0 rather than as the empty
string.  Then:

<ul>
<li> If the parent ends in a 1, then the left child appends a 0, while the right
child appends 11.
<li> If the parent is 1<sup>k</sup>0 with k even, or ends in 01<sup>k</sup> with
k odd, then the left child appends a 1, while the right child replaces the final
0 with 101.
<li> If the parent is 1<sup>k</sup>0 with k odd, or ends in 01<sup>k</sup> with
k even, then the left child replaces the final 10 with 011, while the right
child appends 11.  (Note that the left child of 10 is 11.)
</ul>

This can, again, be proven using the usual hot/cold-style argument.<p>

An interesting consequence of this is that L(F<sub>k</sub>)=F<sub>k+1</sub> for
k&ge;6.<p>

OK, but what about T<sub>4</sub> and up?

<h3>Unknown territory</h3>

For T<sub>4</sub> and up, I don't have any good description.  These ones so far
seem pretty wild compared to T<sub>3</sub> and below.<p>

However, that doesn't mean there's nothing interesting going on here!  If you
draw these trees yourself, you will see that Fibonacci patterns are still
evident.  For instance, <b>it appears that in T<sub>4</sub>,
L(F<sub>k</sub>)=F<sub>k+1</sub> for k&ge;5</b>, and <b>it similarly appears
that R(F<sub>k</sub>-2)=F<sub>k+2</sub>-1 for k&ge;6</b>.<p>

Are these patterns real?  Will they, or similar ones, continue to hold for
higher values of c, likely with higher starting points before they kick in?  I
don't know!  A good question for the future.<p>

<hr>

<a name="paper"><sup>1</sup>Could this be a paper?  Probably, assuming the main
parts turn out to be original, but first I'm making this quick informal public
writeup so that I have something to cite when I add this information on OEIS!
Formalizing everything to make it a paper can come eventually, meanwhile I've
got other papers I need to get out...<p>

<a name="nodups"><sup>2</sup>This is always well-defined, because the tree
contains no duplicates.  Each new left child can't be a duplicate by definition.
Each new right child must be bigger than the corresponding parent and left
child, which, since parents are processed in order and left children are
added in order, means that it must also be bigger than each existing left child
and each existing parent.  But also, from the monotonicity of addition, it must
also be bigger than each existing right child, since each is a sum of a parent
and a left child, and this new one is the sum of the largest parent and largest
left child.  (Also, the tree contains all positive integers, due to the rule for
generating left children.  So it contains each positive integer exactly
once.)<p>

<a name="fib"><sup>3</sup>OK, you want a list of ways that we've found?  OK.
Here, L(n) means the left child of n, while R(n) means the right child of n.

<a name="dbz"><sup>6</sup>Note that there's no such thing as dual bijective
Zeckendorf, because in such a system it would be impossible to represent the
number 3.<p>

<a name="credit"><sup>7</sup>This proof is primarily due to Ophelia.<p>

<a name="parity"><sup>8</sup>This proof will rely on the following nontrivial
fact about Fibonacci numbers: If we consider "pseduo-Zeckendorf
representations", that is, Zeckendorf representations with no consecutivity
restrictions, then the "left shift" operation (appending a 0) is well-defined.
I'm going to relegate the proof of that to a separate footnote.<a
href="#wd"><sup>9</sup></a><p>

Anyway, suppose w is the Zeckendorf representation of n, and w ends in k zeroes,
so w=w'0<sup>k</sup>; w' is then also a Zeckendorf representation of some number
n', and w' ends in a 1.  Let v be the Zeckendorf representation of n'-1, which,
since w' ends in a 1, is simply w' with its final 1 changed to a 0.  Therefore,
the value of v0<sup>k</sup> is n-f<sub>k</sub>, where here by f<sub>k</sub> I
mean F<sub>k+2</sub> (that conflicts with another convention, I know, sorry).
<p>

Now let u be the dual Zeckendorf representation of n'-1; by the lemma, the value
of u0<sup>k</sup> is therefore also equal to n-f<sub>k</sub>.  So, if k is even
with k=2&ell;, then u':=u(10)<sup>&ell;</sup> has value
n-f<sub>k</sub>+(f<sub>k</sub>-1)=n-1, and is also in dual Zeckendorf; so it's
the dual Zeckendorf representation of n-1.  Similarly, if k is odd with
k=2&ell;+1, then u':=u(10)<sup>&ell;</sup>1 has value
n-f<sub>k</sub>+(f<sub>k</sub>-1)=n-1, and it too is in dual Zeckendorf, so once
again it's the dual Zeckendorf representation of n-1.<p>

Now let's consider what happens as n varies.  Going by the above, if k is even,
then u' ends in a 0; so appending 1 to u' corresponds to appending 0 to w, and
appending 10 to u' corresponds to appending 00 to w.<p>

On the other hand, if k is odd, then u' ends in a 1.  Appending 1 to u'
is the same as appending 0 and then incrementing; so this corresponds to
appending 0 to w and then incrementing, which appends a 1.  Similarly, appending
10 to u' we can think of as appending 01 and then incrementing; so this
corresponds to appending 00 to w and then incrementing, which appends a 01.
This completes the proof.<p>

<a name="wd"><sup>9</sup>It suffices to show that if w is a pseudo-Zeckendorf
representation representing the number n, and v is the Zeckendorf representation
of n, then w0 and v0 again represent the same number.  Note that v0 is again a
Zeckendorf representation, so we are showing that the number represented by w0
has Zeckendorf representation v0.<p>

To show this, note that any pseudo-Zeckendorf representation can be converted to
Zeckendorf representing the same number by the following procedure: Find the
leftmost "11" (which cannot be preceded by another 1 or it would not be
leftmost), then change this "011" to a "100"; repeat until there are no 11's
(and this procedure must terminate because the number of 1's decreases with each
step).  Now observe that this procedure (both each step and the termination
condition) commutes with appending a 0.  This proves the claim.<p>

<a name="lex"><sup>10</sup>The identity of these two descriptions of the tree
might not be obvious, but it follows from the fact that to compare two numbers
written in dual Zeckendorf, you just do so lexicographically.  This in turn can
be proven by comparing the smallest possible dual Zeckendorf number of a given
length with the largest possible dual Zeckendorf number that's one shorter in
length.<p>

<a name="append1"><sup>11</sup>Note that this proof needs to use the fact that
appending 1 to pseudo-Zeckendorf representations is well-defined.  You could
prove this by first proving it for 0, as done above, and then note that
appending 1 is just appending 0 and then incrementing; or you could do it
directly, mimicking the above proof for 0, except you'd use dual Zeckendorf
instead of Zeckendorf.<p>
