<h1>Notes on a Fibonacci tree</h1>

So Beren Gunsolus came up with this nifty rule for generating a tree that is
full of Fibonacci numbers, he and I and some others (Astra Kolomatskaia, <a
href="https://twitter.com/orellanin">Ophelia</a>) figured out what's going on
with it, and now I want to tell you about it.<a
href="#paper"><sup>1</sup></a><p>

Beren defined the tree iteratively.  The root is 1.  Then, at each step, we find
the smallest number in the tree that does not have any children<a
href="#nodups"><sup>2</sup></a>, and give it two children; the left child is the
smallest not yet in the tree, and the right child is the sum of the parent and
the left child.<p>

If you do this<a href="#nopics"><sup>3</sup></a>, you'll notice some patterns,
like the Fibonacci numbers going down the right-hand side, or the Fibonacci
numbers minus one going down the left hand side, or any of the many other ways
that Fibonacci numbers appear in the tree.<a href="#fib"><sup>4</sup></a>  You
may also notice some relations that hold but aren't obvious from the original
construction; like, for instance, not only does the parent plus the left child
equal the right child, but also, the left child plus the right child equals the
left child <i>of</i> the right child.<a href="#relations"><sup>5</sup></a><p>

<h2>So what is this tree?</h2>

So, is there some nice description of the tree that explains all of this, that
isn't based on this iterative building rule?  Yes!

You've probably heard of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem">Zeckendorf
representation</a>, which is like "base Fibonacci" (for the purposes of
Zeckendorf the Fibonacci sequence starts 1, 2, 3, 5,...), with the digits being
0 and 1, and the restriction being that there can never be two conseuctive ones.
Well it turns out there's such a thing as <i>dual Zeckendorf</i>, which is the
same thing, except that instead the restriction is that you can't have
consecutive zeroes (the implicit 0's before the initial 1 don't count).<a
href="#bz"><sup>6</sup></a><p>

It turns out that dual Zeckendorf is the key to Beren's tree, if we just
subtract 1 from each number (so now 0 is the root).  If we subtract 1 from each
number, then the root is the empty string, taking the left child corresponds to
appending 1, and taking the right child corresponds to appending 10.  Every
legal dual Zeckendorf representation can be made uniquely in this way, so the
tree contains each whole number exactly once, as we saw earlier.<p>

<h2>Proof of the dual Zeckendorf description</h2>

To prove this<a href="#credit"><sup>8</sup></a>, let's divide positive integers
into "cold" numbers, that end with a 1 in dual Zeckendorf, and "hot" numbers,
that end with a 0 (the number 0 is neither).  We're going to work in the
adjusted tree, which is going to obey the rule R'(n)=n+L'(n)+1 (here L', R'
denote the adjusted operations for this adjusted tree).  Now, we'll group hot
and cold numbers into pairs, where a cold number m will be paired with the hot
number m:0, the colon denoting concatenation.  So in each pair, the cold number
is always smaller.<p>

So, assume as an inductive hypothesis that the theorem is true for all numbers
already in the tree; this means that cold and hot numbers have been added in
pairs.  Then, when we go to process a number n, and we want to determine L'(n),
well, L'(n) cannot be hot, because each excluded hot number has a smaller cold
number that is also excluded.  So L'(n) must be cold, and the smallest excluded
cold number is (applying the inductive hypothesis) n:1.  Then to determine R'(n)
we simply add n, L'(n), and 1, and this addition yields n:10.  This proves the
claim.<p>

Now this new description of the tree may strike you as obviously related to some
other trees, or cause you to ask hey what about such-and-such a natural-seeming
variant, but, we'll get to variants down below.  First I want to tell you about
another phenomenon Beren found.<p>

<h2>The reading sequence and its inverse</h2>

Let's say we read across the rows of the tree, in order, from left to right.  If
we do this, we get the sequence<p>

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 11, 10, 16, 9, 14, 13, 21...<p>

Beren plugged this into OEIS and found that it's <a
href="https://oeis.org/A232560">A232560</a>, which is defined as the inverse
permutation of <a href="https://oeis.org/A232559">A232559</a>, which is in turn
obtained from reading across a <i>different</i> tree.

This other tree is a tree of doubling or adding 1.  It has 1 as the root, and
each node has two children; for the left child you add 1, for the right child
you double.  Well, except that actually not every node has two children -- if we
did that, the tree would be full of duplicates, so, we only allow adding 1 to
numbers that are even.  Odd numbers only get a single child.<p>

From this description, this second tree doesn't seem to have anything to do with
Fibonacci numbers!  Why would it be somehow inverse to the first tree?<p>

That's not the only seemingly odd thing here either.  The second tree isn't even
a binary tree.  If the trees had the same shape, then we could regard these two
permutations not as being on the linearly-ordered natural numbers, but rather on
the nodes of the unlabeled tree of that shape, and show that the permutations
were inverse that way, and then we'd never have to involve this whole "reading
sequence" business.  But since they're not the same shape, that means that in
our two reading order sequences, the row boundaries are falling in different
places.  And yet they're inverse to each other!<p>

Well, it turns out that there's a nice explanation, and that the shape of the
tree is actually not a problem but rather the solution.  You see, the tree that
we started with was a tree based on Fibonacci numbers and (dual) Zeckendorf
representation, but in shape it was a binary tree.  The second tree is based on
binary representation, but its shape is Fibonacci!<p>

If you actually draw the second tree, you'll see the lengths of the rows are
Fibonacci.  Of course they are; it's doing the whole Fibonacci rabbit thing.
Only even-valued nodes (adult rabbits) can have two children, with odd-valued
nodes (juvenile rabbits) having only one.<p>

So, we have a Fibonacci binary tree, and a binary Fiboncci tree.  The inverse
relation makes a bit more sense now, no?<p>

<h2>Switching from binary to bijective binary</h2>

To actually prove it, we'll want to start by subtracing 1 from each number in
both trees, so the roots are now 0 rather than 1.  These are the versions of the
trees we'll work with.  As you know, when you do this to Beren's tree, you get
the dual Zeckendorf tree; 0 is the root (empty string), left child means
appending 1, right child means appending 0.<p>

What about our other tree?  Well, if we <i>don't</i> subtract 1, then it's a
tree of binary representations; 1 is the root; even numbers have two children,
with the left child corresponding to changing the final 0 to a 1, and the right
child corresponding to appending 0; and odd numbers have one child,
corresponding to appending 0.<p>

OK, but what if we do subtract 1?  Well, then it's a tree of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration">bijective</a> binary
representations!  The doubling operation becomes double-and-increment.  So now 0
(the empty string) is the root; it's odd numbers that have two children, with
the left child meaning you change the final 1 to a 2, and the right child
meaning you append a 1; and even numbers have only one child, corresponding to
appending a 1.<p>

<h2>Proof core of the inverse relation</h2>

Anyway, having made the adjustments above, time to start the work of the proof.
In order to see that these trees have inverse reading permutations, I want to
introduce two auxiliary trees.  We have a Fibonacci binary tree and a binary
Fibonacci tree, but for comaprison, I'm going to introduce a binary binary tree
and a Fibonacci Fibonacci tree.<p>

That is to say -- consider the binary tree that, when read across, simply yields
0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  This, if we look at it in bijective binary, can be described
as a tree with root 0 (the empty string), where the left child is append a 1,
and the right child is append a 2.<p>

We can do the same thing on the other side; we can take a tree as the same shape
as our Fibonacci-shaped tree of bijective binary numbers, but one whose reading
sequence is simply 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  This similarly has a natural interpretation
in terms of dual Zeckendorf; left children mean append a zero, right (or only)
children mean you append a 1.  Only numbers that are a 1-child can have a
0-child.<a href="#lex"><sup>9</sup></a><p>

So: Let us consider the permutation that takes our binary binary tree (whose
reading sequence is just the whole numbers) to our Fibonacci (dual-Zeckendorf)
binary tree (which has the same shape).  What does it do to the number at any
given spot?  Well, what you do to the number is, you write the number in
bijective binary; then you change each 2 to a 10 while leaving each 1 as a 1;
then you interpret the string as dual Zeckendorf.  So that's our permutation one
way.<p>

Now, we consider the permutation that takes our Fibonacci Fibonacci tree (whose
reading sequence is just the whole numbers) to our binary Fibonacci tree (which
has the same shape).  What does this do to the number at any given spot?  Well,
you write the number in bijective binary; then, starting with the empty string,
you interpret each 1 as an "append 1" and each 0 as a "change the final 1 to a
2" (because a 0-child must have a parent that is a 1-child, this is
well-defined); then you interpret the string as bijective binary.  That's our
permutation the other way.<p>

And, well, those two operations are inverse to each other, so there you go!
Where did we use the reading order?  How did we deal with the fact that the two
trees are different shapes?  By setting up two auxiliary trees which, although
they had different shapes from each other, had identical reading sequences.
Basically we had a chain of four trees, FB-BB-FF-BF, where the pairs FB-BB and
FF-BF have the same shape, while the pairs BB-FF have the same reading
sequence.<p>

<h2>Variants and relations among them</h2>

Now, you may have noticed here that we used <i>dual</i> Zeckendorf and
<i>bijective</i> binary, with roots starting from 0.  But what if we had used
<i>ordinary</i> Zeckendorf, with root starting from 1?  Where the left child
meant "append 0" and the right child meant "append 01"?  Well, in that case, the
same argument as above implies that our corresponding "inverse" tree would be a
tree based on <i>ordinary</i> binary, with 1 as the root... a tree that is
<i>almost</i> the same as our original double-or-increment tree, before we
subtracted 1 from everything.  The only difference?  It'd be flipped
left-to-right.  That tree had the left child meaning "change the final 0 to a 1"
(when there were two children) and the right child meaning "append a 0"; here it
would be the other way around.<a href="#ltr"><sup>10</sup></a><p>

To summarize, here's a list of the (nontrivial) involved trees and the relations
between them.  Here, "B" stands for "binary", "Z" stands for "Zeckendorf", "D"
stands for "dual Zeckendorf", and "J" stands for "bijective binary".  The first
letter describes the representation used to make the numbers in the tree, while
the second letter represents the shape of the tree (note "J" is not a separate
shape from "B"), and I'll also put each tree's root in brackets.  And Beren's
original tree I'm just going to label "TB[1]" because I don't have a better
name.<p>

List of involved trees, excluding trivial trees (those whose reading sequences are just consecutive whole numbers or positive integers):
<ul>
<li>TB[1]: Beren's original tree.  Root is 1, generated iteratively by rule
above.
<li>DB[0]: Dual-Zeckendorf binary tree.  Written in dual Zeckendorf, root is
empty string (zero), left child appends 1, right child appends 10.
<li>BD[1]: The original double-or-increment tree.  Written in binary, root is 1,
left child (for even numbers only) increments (changes final 0 to 1), right
child doubles (appends 0).
<li>JD[0]: Double-and-increment-or-just-increment tree.  Written in bijective
binary, root is empty string (zero), left child (for odd numbers only)
increments (changes final 1 to a 2), right child doubles and increments (appends
1).
<li>BZ[1]: Double-or-increment tree, but reversed.  Written in binary, root is
1, left doubles (appends 0), right child (for even numbers only) increments
(changes final 0 to 1).
<li>ZB[1]: Zeckendorf binary tree.  Written in Zeckendorf, root is 1, left child
appends 0, right child appends 01.
</ul>

List of relations among involved trees:

<ul>
<li>TB[1] = DB[0] + 1
<li>BD[1] = JD[0] + 1
<li>BD[1] = flip(BZ[1])
<li>TB[1] and BD[1] have inverse reading permutations.
<li>DB[0] and JD[0] have inverse reading permutations.
<li>ZB[1] and BZ[1] have inverse reading permutations.
</ul>

Um, I realize that's likely a bit confusing, but I hope it clears things up
somewhat?  Here's a diagram<a href="#ascii"><sup>11</sup></a>:
<pre>      inverse
DB[0] ------- JD[0]
 |-1            |-1
 |              |
 |+1  inverse   |+1
TB[1] ------- BD[1]
                |
                |flip
      inverse   |
ZB[1] ------- BZ[1]</pre>
...where the left column is binary trees with Fibonacci-based contents, and the
right column is Fibonacci-shaped trees with binary-based contents.<p>

By the way, you may be wondering, what about bijective Zeckendorf?
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to fit nicely into the picture above.<p>

<h2>One last alternate description</h2>

I'll close with one additional description of Beren's original tree.  If you
write the original tree (not adjusted, the root is 1) in ordinary (not dual)
Zeckendorf, there's another pattern you may spot.  As noted, the root is 1.
Then, to get the children of a given node, if the node ends in an even number of
zeroes, then the left child appends 0 and the right child appends 00.  While if
the node ends in an odd number of zeroes, then the left child appends 1, while
the right child appends 01.<p>

I know of two ways to prove this equivalence.  The first is to once again adapt
Ophelia's cold/hot argument to this new description, directly proving its
equivalence with Beren's original description.  So, in this proof you'd define a
cold' number to be one that (in ordinary Zeckendorf) ends with an even number of
0s and ends in a 0, or ends in an even number of 0s followed by a 1; while a
hot' number would be one that ends with an odd number of 0s, or ends in an odd
number of 0s followed by a 1.  (The number 1 is neither cold' nor hot'.  Note of
course it will turn out that n is cold' iff n-1 is cold and n is hot' iff n-1 is
hot.)  This adaptation is straightforward and I won't belabor it.<p>

The second is to directly prove its equivalence with the dual Zeckendorf
description; doing this requires making use of a nontrivla fact about sums of
Fibonacci numbers that I haven't discussed here in order to handle the switch
between the two representations.  If this were an actual paper I might include
the proof, but here, I'll just leave it for you to think about!<p>

<a name="paper"><sup>1</sup>Could this be a paper?  Probably, assuming the main
parts turn out to be original, but first I'm making this quick informal public
writeup so that I have something to cite when I add this information on OEIS!
Formalizing everything to make it a paper can come eventually, meanwhile I've
got other papers I need to get out...<p>

<a name="nodups"><sup>2</sup>This is always well-defined, because the tree
contains no duplicates.  Each new left child can't be a duplicate by definition.
Each new right child must be bigger than the corresponding parent and left
child, which, since parents are processed in order and left children are
added in order, means that it must also be bigger than each existing left child
and each existing parent.  But also, from the monotonicity of addition, it must
also be bigger than each existing right child, since each is a sum of a parent
and a left child, and this new one is the sum of the largest parent and largest
left child.  (Also, the tree contains all positive integers, due to the rule for
generating left children.  So it contains each positive integer exactly
once.)<p>

<a name="nopics"><sup>3</sup>Where are the pictures of this tree, you ask?  Man,
the point of this page was to be quick.  If I had to include pictures, it
wouldn't be quick.<p>

<a name="fib"><sup>4</sup>OK, you want a list of ways that we've found?  OK.
Here, L(n) means the left child of n, while R(n) means the right child of n.
<ul>
<li> The obvious one: R<sup>n</sup>(1)=F<sub>2n+2</sub> and
LR<sup>n</sup>(1)=F<sub>2n+3</sub>
<li> The slightly less obvious one I've already mentioned:
L<sup>k</sup>(1)=F<sub>k+3</sub>-1.
<li> A generalization of the previous two:
R<sup>n</sup>L<sup>k</sup>(1)=F<sub>2n+k+3</sub>-F<sub>2n+1</sub> and
LR<sup>n</sup>L<sup>k</sup>(1)=F<sub>2n+k+4</sub>-F<sub>2n+2</sub>.
<li> One more: L&sup2;R<sup>n</sup>(1)=F<sub>2n+4</sub>+1 and
RLR<sup>n</sup>(1)=F<sub>2n+5</sub>+1.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="relations"><sup>5</sup>You want a list of what we found there too?  OK.
Again, L(n) means the left child of n, while R(n) means the right child of n.
<ul>
<li> This one holds by definition: n+L(n)=R(n)
<li> The less obvious one I've already mentioned: L(n)+R(n)=LR(n).
<li> A related one, but don't try to generalize, it won't work:
L&sup2;(n)+LR(n)=L&sup3;(n).
<li> One that explains the RLR<sup>n</sup>(1) rule: RL(n)=LR(n)+1.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="bz"><sup>6</sup>Speaking of Zeckendorf variants, there's also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration">bijective</a>
Zeckendorf!  As in, instead of 0 and 1, you use 1 and 2, and you can't have two
consecutive 2's.<a href="#dbz"><sup>7</sup></a>  Now, famously bijective binary
holds a special relation with ordinary binary, where the bijective binary for n
is the same as the ordinary binary for n+1, but with the initial 1 stripped off
and each digit incremented by 1.  A similar relation holds for bijective
Zeckendorf; the bijective Zeckendorf for n is the ordinary Zeckendorf for n+2
but with the initial 10 stripped off and each digit incremented.
<p>

<a name="dbz"><sup>7</sup>Note that there's no such thing as dual bijective
Zeckendorf, because in such a system it would be impossible to represent the
number 3.<p>

<a name="credit"><sup>8</sup>This proof is primarily due to Ophelia.<p>

<a name="lex"><sup>9</sup>The identity of these two descriptions of the tree
might not be obvious, but it follows from the fact that to compare two numbers
written in dual Zeckendorf, you just do so lexicographically.  This in turn can
be proven by comparing the smallest possible dual Zeckendorf number of a given
length with the largest possible dual Zeckendorf number that's one shorter in
length.<p>

<a name="ltr"><sup>10</sup>At this point you might point out that the choice of
reading left-to-right is arbitrary, so we ought to consider the right-to-left
reading order as well.  You might also point out that the choice of which
children go on the left, and which go on the right, is arbitrary as well.  And,
this is true, so we could also consider reverse reading order.  However, there
isn't a true need to do so, as all the relations regarding reverse reading are
already implicit in what I'm already writing; you can figure them out yourselves
if you want.  And, I claim, the left/right convention here is in fact not
totally arbitrary, but is being chosen in a way that has a consistent sense to
it, even if it might take some work to write down that sense.<p>
