<h1>Are probabilities in groups well-ordered?</h1>

So, this is speculation without having done my homework first -- I haven't
really tried to look at the existing literature here.  If you know of any,
please let me know!  Because perhaps way more is known on this than I know.<p>

Anyway, this is based on combining ideas from two papers: firstly, <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0848">Commuting Probabilities of Finite
Groups</a>, by Sean Eberhard (thanks to Juan Arias de Reyna for pointing this
out to me), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4353">Word-Induced Measures
on Compact Groups</a>, by John Wiltshire-Gordon and Gene Kopp.<p>

So, first, let's summarize the first of these papers.  If you have a finite
group, you can consider the probability that a randomly chosen ordered pair of
elements from it commutes. You could then consider the set of all probabilities
obtained this way; this is some set of rational numbers between 0 and 1.<p>

In this paper, Eberhard shows that this set is in fact reverse well-ordered!
Moreover, its (reverse) order type is either &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> or
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>2</sup></sup>.  He also shows that all the limit points
of this set are rational.  (Although I hear it's conjectured that this set is
actually closed in (0,1]?)<p>

Here's my questions:
<ol>
<li>Obvious question: Is it &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> or is it
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>2</sup></sup>?  (Maybe this has been answered.  Like I
said, I haven't done my homework on this one.)
<li>What if we allowed compact groups instead of just finite groups?  Obviously
this would allow 0 as well; would it allow anything else?  Would it just be the
closure of the finite case, say?  (So the order type would be either
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>+1 or &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>2</sup></sup>+1.)  That
would be nice, certainly!
<li>The big question: What if we tried using other words?  That is to say: We
pick a word from some free group F<sub>n</sub>, and consider the probability
that a randomly chosen n-tuple from G satisfies that word.  Would we still get
(reverse) well-ordering?  What can be said about the order type and the
closure?  (And obviously we can try this one with compact groups too.)
</ol>

It's this third question that's the most interesting to me.  Say our word is
just "a", in F<sub>1</sub>.  Then obviously for finite groups we just get
&omega;, or &omega;+1 for compact groups.  But what about other words in
F<sub>1</sub>?  I.e., counting elements of order dividing some fixed k?  That
sounds like a good place to start before tackling the general problem.  For the
particular case of the word a&sup2;, i.e. counting elements of order at most 2,
it is at least known that there's a gap between &frac34; and 1... but is that
the start of a well-ordering?

(Note that another easy case is the F<sub>2</sub> word "ab", which will again
get you &omega;.  More generally this will work for any word
a<sub>1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>&isin;F<sub>n</sub> for n&gt;0, where the
a<sub>i</sub> are the free generators.  But that's kind of a trivial case.  (I
suppose an even more trivial case would be n=0, where you get 1 as your order
type.  But...))<p>

Not something I'm going to work on, though... (of course, maybe someone's
already done it and I don't know!)<p>
