<h1>Minimum and maximum possible scores in Space Alert</h1>
by <a href="https://hjaltman.github.io/">Harry Altman</a><p>

<i>Note</I>: In this article I will primarily only be considering <i>Space
Alert</i> without its expansion, <i>The New Frontier</i>.  This is because I do
not at present own a copy of <i>The New Frontier</i>.  I do have some
familiarity with it, and will make some notes on it at the end; however, it
would be difficult to conduct the same level of detailed analysis without first
buying a copy.<p>

In this article I would to consider the questions, "What is the lowest possible
surviving score in a game of Space Alert?" and "What is the highest possible
score in a game of Space Alert?". (I like to say that dying is -&infin; points,
but that is not very interesting.)<p>

Let's be clear on the parameters of the problem -- this is Space Alert without
the expansion.  4 or 5 players may be used. The players are actively trying to
achieve the lowest/highest score. Any deck of threats may be used, any set of
trajectories, etc.; we assume we are allowed to rig all the decks (damage tiles,
etc.) and that the players know in advance everything that will happen. The
audio track must be one of the 8 normal missions provided.<p>

Some terminology: Let's define the "threat count" of a mission to be the number
of common threats plus twice the number of serious threats.  (This is in fact
the term used for it in the <i>New Frontier</i> rulebook.)  This is a useful
quantity, because serious threats of a given difficulty level are (with a few
exceptions) worth twice as much as common threats of that same level.
Furthermore, it is constant across mission types -- it's equal to 3 for the test
runs, 5 for simulation or advanced simulation (6 with 5 players), 7 for a
mission (8 with 5 players), and if we include the expansion, it's equal to 8 for
the easier double-action missions (10 with 5 players), and 10 for the standard
double-action missions (12 with 5 players). So for our purposes now this
quantity will always be equal to 7 or 8.<p>

<h2>The maximum problem</h2>

First, the maximum problem; this is the easier one. There's an obvious upper
bound on the maximum possible score, which is 8*6+21=<b>69</b>. (8 threat count,
times 6 points for destroying a yellow threat, plus 21 points from the window.)
69 points is a "perfect game"... but is it actually possible?<p>

Well, after several hours of trying to construct such a scenario, I can report
that the answer is yes.  What follows is one solution.  Note of course that
there may well be other solutions that look very different.<p>

We use 5 players and audio track 8.  For the trajectories, we put T3 on blue
zone, T6 on white zone, T4 on red zone, and T1 internally.  For the threats, we
have an Overheated Reactor at time T+3, a Psionic Satellite at T+4, a Nebula
Crab at T+5, a Juggernaut at T+7, and a Scout at T+8.<p>

Finally, the moves.  Players will move in the order Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Purple.<br>
Turn 1: Red hits C, all other players change decks. (Green, Blue, and Purple are
delayed.)<br>
Turn 2: Red changes decks, Yellow hits B, all other players do nothing.<br>
Turn 3: All players press C. (7 points.)<br>
Turn 4: All players press C. (7 points.)<br>
Turn 5: Red uses heroic B (the other side of which shows upper red). Yellow
presses B. (Overheated Reactors destroyed.) Green moves blueward. Blue changes
decks. Purple heroically rushes to upper blue. (Psionic Satellite reaches X. All
players are delayed.)<br>
Turn 6: All players do nothing.<br>
Turn 7: Yellow moves redward; all other players press A. (Psionic Satellite
destroyed; Nebula Crab takes 3 damage. Nebula crab reaches X.)<br>
Turn 8: Red and Green move redward. Yellow and Purple change decks. Blue presses
C. (Nebula crab reaches Y.)<br>
Turn 9: Purple presses C; all other players press A. (Nebula Crab destroyed;
Juggernaut takes 4 damage. Scout reaches X.)<br>
Turn 10: Blue changes decks; Purple presses C; all other players press A.
(Juggernaut destroyed.)<br>
Turn 11: Red moves blueward; Yellow heroically rushes to lower white; Green
presses B; Blue presses A; Purple moves redward. (Scout destroyed.)<br>
Turn 12: All players press C. (7 points.)<p>

I have not listed what the other side of each card does, but it's pretty easy to
fill these in in a manner consistent with the contents of the deck.

<h2>The minimum problem</h2>

First, let's note some lower bounds.  There's an obvious lower bound of -36, if
the players take all the penalties and gain no points.  It may seem like this
should be 7*2-36=-22, because you get 2 points for surviving a white threat;
however, one must remember that it's possible to survive the mission without
destroying or surviving every threat, since one only counts as having "survived"
a threat if it reaches Z.  We can, however, make a lower bound based on this
idea.<p>

The longest trajectory, T7, is 16 spaces long; a threat needs to advance 15
spaces to reach Z. If it has speed 3 or more (let's assume everything is
constant speed for now), it will assuredly reach Z regardless of when it
appears. If it has speed 2, however, it will have to appear by turn 6 to reach
Z; and if it has speed 1, it will never reach Z. One can come up with similar
numbers for the other trajectories; I won't go into details here. Note that
straight-up "speed 1" threats do not exist -- there are two "speed 1" threats,
the Man-of-War and the Juggernaut, and both speed up. It's straightforward to
compute numbers for both of these. (Be careful, the Juggernaut has the odd
property that it sometimes arrives <i>sooner</i> on longer trajectories.) There
are no threats that lose speed so these are not a concern.<p>

Let's now analyze the audio tracks.  We'll consider both what happens with only
4 players and with 5 players -- while having fewer threats may seem better for
our purposes, let's remember that with 4 players, one can only get -8 points
from knockouts, not -10.  I will not go through the full analysis here, but
after a bit of work, we find the following (not necessarily unique) minima for
points let through:<p>
Track 1: 10 points (put T7 on red); 12 points with 5 players.<br>
Track 2: 12 points (put T6 or T7 on blue); 14 points with 5 players.<br>
Track 3: 6 points (put T7 on blue and T6 on white, with T+6 being the
Man-of-War); still 6 points with 5 players (put T5 on red).<br>
Track 4: 10 points (put T7 on blue, with T+6 being the Man-of-War); 12 points
with 5 players.<br>
Track 5: 12 points (put T7 on red and T6 on white); still 12 points with 5
players.<br>
Track 6: 12 points (put T6 on red); still 12 points with 5 players (put T7 on
white).<br>
Track 7: 10 points (put T7 on red and T6 on white); 12 points with 5
players.<br>
Track 8: 6 points (put T7 on red and T6 on white, with T+5 being the
Man-of-War); still 6 points with 5 players (put T5 on blue).<p>

This yields a lower bound of -30 points.  But in fact, we will see that -30 is
not achievable.  Let's consider -- achieving this requires knocking out all
players. But there's not too many ways to do that in the base game. Especially
since the threat that delivers the knockout must either be white, or else knock
the players out without reaching Z. The only white threats that knock out are
the Battlebot Uprising and the Commandos (both serious internal). The only
threats that knock out without reaching Z are the Battlebot Uprising, the
Executioner, and the Power System Overload (all serious internal).<p>

(Note: Although it will not be relevant here, Executioner and the Power System
Overload each lack the ability to knock <i>all</i> players out, and so if we
are relying on one of them to deliver the knockout, we must have both. (Or
rather, Executioner can knock all players out, but it can't both knock out all
players and disable both battlebot squads.))<p>

From this we can see that -30 is not achievable with track 8, since its only
internal threat is a common threat, incompatible with the above. Track 3 can be
ruled out for similar reasons. Thus -30 is not achievable. And since there are
no common threats that knocks out, one can deduce that -29 is not achievable
either.<p>

However, it turns out that <b>-28</b> is achievable.  We use 5 players and audio
track 8.  For the trajectories, we put T5 on blue zone, T6 on white zone, T7 on
red zone, and T4 internally.  For the threats, we have Hacked Shields (blue) at
T+3, a Psionic Satellite at T+4, a Man-of-War at T+5, a Frigate at T+7, and a
Gunship at T+8.  I will not include the execution details here because they are
mostly fairly obvious -- the gist of it is, pick up the battlebots, fiddle with
the shields, then get knocked out.  You need 2 shield up on red.  Note also
that you need exactly 2 shield up on white, which means first you'll have to
hit B in lower red before filling up the white shield. Don't worry about the
blue shield; it'll take care of itself.<p>

<h3>Notes on variable-range interceptors</h3>

While the variable-range interceptor rules are only intended for double-action
missions, many people I know play with them in all missions.  However, this
rules variant does not affect the maximum or minimum.  It clearly cannot affect
the maximum, but it could be used to knock two players out without a threat,
potentially allowing a lower minimum.  However, in fact, -30 and -29 remain
unachievable, as you would still need at least one threat to knock the other
three players out, and so the logic above still holds, so -28 remains the
minimum.

<h2>Notes on <i>The New Frontier</i></h2>

As noted above, I cannot presently conduct the same level of detailed analysis
on <i>The New Frontier</i>.  I can, however, make a few notes.

<h3>Notes on the maximum problem</h3>

<i>The New Frontier</i> raises the score for a "perfect game" from 69 to 90 --
or to 122 for a double-action mission.  It does this in several ways:

<ol>
<li> The inclusion of red threats; these are worth more points than yellow
threats.  A common red threat is worth 4 if survived (as opposed to 3 for yellow
or 2 for white).</li>
<li> The Data Analyst's basic action; use of this action gives you +1
point.</li>
<li> The Data Analyst's advanced action; use of this action allows you to get up
to 4 extra points.</li>
<li> This one's not relevant to a perfect game, but it is technically a new way
to get additional points. By using the Medic's or the Special Ops's advanced
action against the Seeker, you can avoid being knocked out by it (though your
battlebots will still be disabled). The Seeker is worth 15 points if destroyed
instead of the expected 12 to compensate for the knockout effect, meaning you
normally only get 12 points out of it despite its listed number being higher;
this allows you to get 14 points out of it (with Special Ops) or 13 points out
of it (with Medic). Of course, that's still less than you'd get from just
destroying a serious red threat instead, so as noted, it's not relevant to a
perfect game.</li>
</ol>

Thus, the new upper bound is 8*8+25+1=90 for a normal mission, and 12*8+25+1=122
for a double-action mission.  (Note that we get only 1 point from the Data
Analyst's basic action, not 2, as we are also using the Data Analyst's advanced
action.)  It is not at all clear, however, whether scores of 90 or 122 are
actually achievable.  Analysis of that will have to wait for a later time,
though.

<h3>Notes on the minimum problem</h3>

What about the minimum?  In the base game, we had an absolute lower bound of -36
based on getting only penalties; a lower bound of -30 based on analyzing the
audio tracks, trajectories, and threat speeds; and an actual minimum of -28.
The expansion affords us several ways we might lower all of these.  Let us
address them in reverse order.

<ol>
<li> The Plasmatic Fighter; the Plasmatic Fighter can knock people out, but is
a white common threat.</li>
<li> More slow threats; the expansion adds in more threats that have an initial
speed of 1. If I recall correctly, they all speed up later, but these should
still be useful for lowering point values, just as the Man-of-War is.  Many are
yellow or red, but in this context that doesn't matter.</li>
<li>In a double-action mission, variable-range interceptors can be used to have
a player knock themself out without the aid of a threat.</li>
<li> Calling in threats. Several of the serious red threats call in another
threat; these threats are only worth the points of a red common threat (4/8)
instead of a red serious threat (8/16). This is still too many points to be
helpful for this, but it's worth noting. A called-in threat may not appear until
quite late, making it easy for it to be neither destroyed nor survived. However
there is one case that is helpful...</li>
<li> The Sealed Capsule. The Sealed Capsule is the one red common threat that
calls in another threat; it is worth no points at all. (Yellow and white threats
never call in other threats.) This, unlike the ones above, does seem helpful for
reducing one's score.  Especially because, once again, the called in threat may
not appear until quite late.</li>
<li> The Hypernavigator's basic action; the Hypernavigator's basic action can be
used to have threats move one less space that turn. The application is
obvious.</li>
<li> The Hypernavigator's advanced action; this allows the ship to jump to
hyperspace after turn 10 or 11 instead of 12 (although there is always a "turn
13", no matter what). The application, once again, is obvious.</li>
<li>The Medic's advanced action; use of this action costs you 1 point.</li>
</ol>

So, #1 probably allows us to achieve -30, and #2-#7 probably allows us to
achieve -36; indeed, they seem like overkill for achieving -36.  Finally, #8
should allow us to achieve -37.  I have, of course, not checked that -37 is
actually achievable -- that will have to wait for a later time -- but I
strongly suspect that it is.
