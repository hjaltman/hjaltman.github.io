    <p>Hi! I'm Harry Altman, aka Sniffnoy.  You might have encountered me on the
    internet before.  I do math, and in particular I can talk your ear off about
    the problem of writing numbers with ones, addition, and multiplication!  And
    lots of variants of the problem.  I won't do that here though, I'll save
    that for later.  :D</p>

    <p>Also I like infinities.  I've also been working a bunch on doing silly
    things with infinities.  This is actually much easier, but unfortunately
    it's way harder to explain to people!  Again, best saved for another time.
    :)  Also various other math things, like some neat Fibonacci things
    recently, but, uh, this isn't supposed to be a research statement, so I'll
    move on to a different topic. :P</p>

    <p>I don't actually have an academic position anywhere, so this past 5 years
    I've worked a programming job to support my math habit. :)  I was writing an
    Ethereum smart contract debugger, if you're interested; but that's come to a
    close now so now I have a lot more time to get other things done again!</p>

    <p>OK so the thing is... like, I guess this is a place to describe oneself,
    but I'm kind of averse to doing that?  I guess a big thing there is that I
    worry about verbal overshadowing and also creating fixity, that by
    describing myself I will thereby cause myself to identify with those
    descriptions, which is something I want to avoid.</p>

    <p>So, well, I guess I will try to say only things that are quite definitely
    true, or to show rather than telling!</p>

    <p>I guess, I like things that are a bit off from what people expect.
    Sometimes, as in my mathematical work, these things are quite natural -- but
    nature doesn't always meet your expectations!  Or (to take a page from
    Yudkowsky's book), I should say that people's expectations don't always meet
    nature. üòÅ  Sometimes nice questions have nasty answers, and I like to
    disgust people with them. :D  And sometimes nasty-seeming constructions have
    nice results, and I like to amaze people with them!</p>

    <p>But I'm interested in the artificial as well as the natural; a thing I
    find really fascinating is, like, bizarrely complicated conventions and
    understanding where they come from and all the weird cases they generate.
    Things like text encoding (particularly Unicode) and data encoding in
    computers; unusual calendars (it's fun to explain the Hebrew calendar to
    people üòÅ); and other such things.  I am trying to more often say "huh,
    that's a strange word, I wonder where it comes from?" and look up its
    etymology.  So many things that appear to not make sense, the reason is, it
    used to make sense, but then it wasn't updated when circumstances changed!
    And I really like learning about the history of how that occurred.</p>

    <p>I also like taking pictures of the local wildlife, which mostly means
    bugs and birds. :)  Here in New York mostly birds, I don't see a lot of good
    bugs here.  Although there are rats! :D  Of course, rats don't like light or
    people, which makes photographing them tricky, but it can be done!  Back in
    Ann Arbor I'd see a lot more good bugs.</p>

    <p>Uh, what are other good stories for illustrating myself?  Um, here's one
    that comes to mind.  Once, I was visiting my friends Colin and Aviva out in
    Chicago, and we were in the car, along with their dog, Gately.  (Gately has
    since died, unfortunately.)  I was in the back seat, and Gately was in the
    center of the car.  And I thought, you know, dogs are always sniffing each
    other's butts. Gately's butt is right there; I could totally sniff it.  So
    uh I tried sniffing Gately's butt.  It stunk!  Not that much though.  I
    don't think I really learned anything from doing this. :P</p>

    <p>(Perhaps my favorite thing that anyone has ever said about me: "Harry,
    you are very good at making arguments, but you are not good at not doing
    annoying things with the cat toy." üòÅ)</p>
