<h1>Equational probabilities in algebraic structures: What can we rule
out?</h1>

I already have a page asking about <a href="groupprob.html">equational
probabilities in groups</a>.  But recently people have asked me, what about
Moufang loops?  And what about rings?  So, I thought I'd put together this page
where I asked the question for a large variety of algebraic structures.<p>

For each of these classes of algebraic structures, I'm going to ask the
questions, could equational probabilities exhibit a gap, and could they be
reverse well-ordered?  Note that for most of these that just means equational
probabilities in the finite case; the compact case doesn't make sense for most
of these.  So typically I'll only be talking about the finite case, but I'll
make notes about the compact case when it's defined and relevant.  For each
class of structures, I'm going to produce a judgment of <b>True</b>,
<b>Trivially true</b>, <b>Plausible</b>, <b>Plausible?</b>, <b>Plausible??</b>,
<b>???</b>, <b>Implausible</b>, <b>False for well-ordering</b>, or <b>False</b>.
(Note that "trivially true" is reserved for those varieties that contain no
finite (or, when applicable, compact) structures.)  We won't consider the
question of whether these sets are closed, because we already know that's false
for groups if you only allow finite groups (x<sup>p</sup>=1 for p an odd prime
is a counterexample).<p>

Which classes of structures am I including?  That's basically a judgment call.
But for simplicity I am going to restrict my attention to finite-signature,
finitely-axiomatized
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra)">varieties</a>.
So, no fields (not a variety), no vector spaces over <b>R</b> (not a finite
signature), etc.  All ring-like algebras will be considered over <b>Z</b>, not
over a field!  Also, whenever I consider "differential" anything, I'm always
considering with a single derivation added, not multiple, for simplicity.
Anyway, if you want me to add one, you'll have to give me a reason ("I have a
counterexample and it isn't one you're already using" can be a reason, although
if it's too obscure that may not be sufficient).<p>

Please send any corrections, updates, or additions to
<script type="text/javascript">document.write("<n \
uers=\"znvygb:uneel.w.nygzna@tznvy.pbz\" \
ery=\"absbyybj\">uneel.w.nygzna@tznvy.pbz</n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g,
function(c)
{return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script> (if you can't see that address, that's because it's been obfuscated
with Javascript to fool spammers).<p>

I should stress that it is very possible that many of these classes have easy
counterexamples that I've missed!  If you know of them, please send them in!<p>

Also, I'm beginning to wonder if, rather than thinking in terms of probabilities
of a given <i>equation</i> holding, it makes more sense to think in terms of a
given expression being equal to any fixed constant (not necessarily one from the
signature).  But, oh well, I'm leaving this in the former terms regradless.<p>

Finally, some of these terms have multiple inequivalent definitions... in case
of ambiguity, I'm always using the notions defined on Wikipedia (as of 2 January
2022).

Anyway, on to the list!

<h2>Group-like structures</h2>

<h3>Groups</h3>

The original question.  A few nontrivial cases (well-ordering for ab=ba, a gap
for a&sup2;=1, a gap for a&sup3;=1 in the finite case) are even proven, and
the former two of these even have their top &omega; or so computed.  This whole
page is more or less proceeding from the assumption that this is reasonable
conjecture for groups, so I obviously have to rule this one <b>plausible</b>.<p>

Also, I'm not going to make a separate header for this, but we can also
possibly consider groups with one or more automorphisms (or just endomorphisms)
attached, possibly satisfying identities.  For instance, the results that are
known for a&sup2;=1, are actually known more generally for
&sigma;(a)=a<sup>-1</sup>, for &sigma; an automorphism satisfying
&sigma;&sup2;=1.  These seem plausible too?

<h3>Abelian groups</h3>

This one is easily proven to be <b>true (including for the compact case)</b>,
since every word in n variables is also a homomorphism (from a power of the
group to the group), and so its kernel is a subgroup; thus the probabilities we
get are all of the form 1/n, and our order type can never be larger than
&omega;.

It's worth noting here -- for reasons that will become relevant later -- that
this one is even true even if you allow constants; then you're just dealing with
cosets rather than subgroups.  It will also be relevant later that it's still
true if you equip the group with one or more endomorphisms.<p>

<h3>Monoids, commutative monoids</h3>

OK, so if we add additional conditions we can prove it true; what if we start
relaxing conditions?  Let's start by removing inverses.<p>

Well, removing things makes things easily <b>false</b>.  For a counterexample,
let's take a finite set S, designate one element as the identity and another as
the sink, and simply define the sum of any two non-identity elements to be the
sink.  Our equation can then simply be <b>a+b=c+d</b>; as |S| increases, the
probability of this being satisfied will approach 1.<p>

This example illustrates an important point -- in order to avoid easy
counterexamples of this form, <i>structures have to be sink-resistant</i>!
This usually means having some form of inverses, but not necessarily, as we'll
see later.

<h3>Moufang loops</h3>

So, instead let's weaken associativity, and look at Moufang loops.  It's hard to
say, obviously, but I'm going to rule these <b>plausible</b>.  A lot of things
that are true for groups end up being true for Moufang loops, but for more
complicated reasons.<p>

For instance, Moufang loops satisfy Lagrange's Theorem, but for complicated
reasons instead of easy ones.  I consider this a good sign.<p>

Moreover, every Moufang loop can be derived from a <i>group with triality</i>,
which is a group with two automorphisms attached satisfying certain identities,
in such a way that if groups with triality obey well-ordering, then so do
Moufang loops.  And as mentioned above, it seems plausible that groups with
automorphisms attached (satisfying specified identities) could obey a
well-ordering law?  We already know abelian groups with automorphisms attached
do so...<p>

I've written more about these <a
href="https://sniffnoy.dreamwidth.org/562083.html">here</a>.<p>

(Also, I'm <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/409658/do-compact-inverse-property-loops-or-just-compact-moufang-loops-have-bi-invari">
unclear on whether it's possible to define Haar measure for arbitrary compact
Moufang loops</a>...)

<h3>Bruck loops, gyrogroups, Bol loops</h3>

At this point we've gotten further away from groups; we no longer even have the
inverse property.<p>

But... Bruck loops and gyrogroups apparently do still satisfy Lagrange's
Theorem.  And Bol loops aren't known to, but they also aren't known <i>not</i>
to, and it is known that the order of an individual element necessarily divides
the order of the loop.<p>

This is getting onto pretty thin ground here, but I'm going to call these
<b>plausible?</b>

<h3>Inverse-property loops</h3>

This case, on the other hand, is <b>false</b>; you do need <i>some</i> sort of
associativity beyond merely the inverse property.<p>

Our equation will be <b>a&sup2;=1</b>  Basically, we use the well-known
construction that turns a group G into a twice-as-large Moufang loop M(G,2); if
instead of putting in a group G, we put in an inverse-property loop L, then the
output will again be an inverse-property loop.  If we start with, say, the
cyclic group C<sub>4</sub>, we can iterate this construction to drive the
involution fraction closer and closer to 1.<p>

Note that this is a class of structures where we got a definitive false answer
even though it's sink-resistant.  Sink-resistance is necessary, but by no means
sufficient.

<h3>Semisymmetric quasigroups, totally symmetric quasigroups, Steiner
quasigroups</h3>

Here's another example to illustrate that; these too are <b>false</b>.  Consider
the Steiner quasigroup obtained from <b>P</b><sup>n</sup><b>F</b><sub>2</sub>;
explicitly, the elements are non-empty subsets of {1,...n}, with ST=S&Delta;T if
S&ne;T and S&sup2;=S.  Then the probability of <b>a(bc)=(ab)c</b> goes to 1 as n
increases, since the equation holds (with both sides equal to a&Delta;b&Delta;c)
except when a=b&ne;c, when a&ne;b=c, or when a&Delta;b&Delta;c=0.

<h3>Sloops</h3>

Given that Steiner quasigroups are false, these presumably are as well; but
I haven't found a counterexample yet, so I'm juding these <b>implausible</b>.

<h3>Medial quasigroups</h3>

These ones, though, we can handle... by applying the Bruck-Murdoch-Toyoda
theorem, we can turn this into the abelian group case, but with a constant and
two commuting endomorphisms.<p>

Hell, we can even consider the compact case and define Haar measure here -- the
different choices of abelian group structure will all yield the same Haar
measure, which will also be invariant under both of our endomorphisms.  So this
is <b>true (including for the compact case)</b>.

<h3>Heaps</h3>

A heap is just a group that's forgotten its origin, so if groups are judged to
be <b>plausible</b>, then heaps must also be, since the equations they can
express are weaker.

<h3>Semiheaps, idempotent semiheaps, generalized heaps</h3>

These structures, on the other hand, fail to be sink-resistant, and so we get an
answer of <b>false</b>.  We can just reuse our monoid example, and define
[a,b,c] to be a+b+c; we can then use the equation <b>[a,b,c]=[d,e,f]</b>.  Note
this example is also commutative.

<h3>Racks, quandles, involutory quandles</h3>

I don't have counterexamples for these, but I also don't know anything about
them.  My judgment can only be <b>???</b>

<h3>Lattice-ordered groups, lattice-ordered monoids</h3>

It's not possible to have nontrivial finite (or, indeed, compact) example of one
of these, so these are <b>trivially true</b>.

<hr>
<h2>Ring-like structures</h2>

<h3>Rings, rngs, commutative rings, commutative rngs</h3>

I'm going to group these all together because they all seem <b>plausible</b>.
I've been able to come up with any counterexamples... distributivity over an
abelian group just makes it really difficult to do much here!  That abelian
group does so much!<p>

Note of course that it will necessarily be true for any equation that doesn't
use the multiplication, because then you just have an abelian group with a
constant.  But those are trivial cases.<p>

Some interesting nontrivial cases where you can easily prove the existence of a
gap are ab=ba (for rings/rngs, including in the compact case; the 5/8 law
reoccurs here), and a&sup2;=a (for commutative rings/rngs, not including the
compact case).  Indeed, for the latter, you can even prove well-ordering,
because it's not too hard to determine all the possible values (they're numbers
of the form 2<sup>k</sup>/n, where n is odd and k&le;&Omega;(n), where
&Omega;(n) is the number of prime factors of n, counting multiplicity).<p>

There's also so many <i>uninteresting</i> and yet not-quite-trivial cases where
you can prove a gap for what I would consider to be stupid reasons; think ab=1
in commutative rings.<p>

Commutative rings, really, feel a bit like fields with their whole thing where a
polynomial (in any number of variables) is either 0 everywhere or else is zero
on only a tiny fraction of the domain; yes, obviously general commutative rings
are a long way from fields, but it still seems like there is <i>enough</i> of
something like that going on here to make this plausible.

<h3>Semirings, commutative semirings, idempotent semirings, star algebras, Conway semirings</h3>

These, on the other hand, fail to be sink-resistant, and so end up being
<b>false</b>.<p>

My example for idempotent semirings (and commutative semirings) actually isn't
sink-based; likely it's possible to come up with a sink-based one, but I haven't
bothered.  Let our base set be {0, 1, ..., n}, and define a+b=max(a,b), and
define ab=max(a,b) if either a or b is nonzero, and ab=0 otherwise.  Then we can
use the equation <b>a+b=ab</b>.<p>

Note also that this example is commutative; and also that if we define
a<sup>*</sup>=max(a,1), it becomes a Kleene algebra, but Kleene algebras don't
form a variety, so they don't get an entry here!<p>

As for Conway semirings (and star algebras), here we'll use a sink approach;
take {0, ..., n} with saturating arithmetic, and define a<sup>*</sup>=n if a is
nonzero and 0<sup>*</sup>=1.  Then the equation
<b>a<sup>*</sup>=b<sup>*</sup></b> does the trick.

<h3>Alternative rings, alernative rngs, non-associative rings, non-associative
rngs</h3>

So, no semirings; we need that sink-resistance.  What if we take rings and rngs
and throw out associativity?<p>

Well, uh... I still have no counterexamples.  Maybe having an abelian group with
a bilinear operation is enough?  I'm going to call this <b>plausible?</b>  Note
that the 5/8 commuting law does still apply to these, it doesn't require
associativity.

<h3>Lie rings, Jordan rings, Poisson rings</h3>

These are types of non-associative rngs, so... <b>plausible?</b>

<h3>Differential rings, differential rngs, differential Lie rings,
differential non-associative rings, differential non-associative rngs</h3>

Tossing in another linear operation seems like it probably shouldn't screw
things up, so... <b>plausible?</b>

<h3>Lie triple systems, Jordan triple systems (over Z)</h3>

Having a trilinear operation rather than a bilinear one doesn't seem like it
should really change things, so... <b>plausible??</b>

<h3>Bol rings</h3>

Now we've got one trilinear operation and one bilinear operation, but I don't
see why that would change things, so... <b>plausible??</b>

<h3>Exponential rings</h3>

OK, now we're finally adding an operation that isn't linear, so I'm going to
judge these <b>???</b>

<h3>Lattice-ordered rings, f-rings</h3>

As with lattice-ordered groups, these are <b>trivially true</b>.

<h3>Near-rings, near-rings with commutative addition</h3>

I've suggested above that distributivity over an abelian group is plausible, but
<i>one-sided</i> distributivity, I'm afraid, is no good; these are <b>false</b>.
(This is different from just adding linear functions, because just adding linear
functions doesn't let you choose one of them at random!)<p>

Take any abelian group for the additive group.  Pick one of the nonzero elements
of the group to be 1; then define ab=0 if b&ne;1, and a1=a.  We can then use the
equation <b>ab=0</b> as our counterexample and let the underlying additive group
get arbitrarily large.

<h3>Near-rings with identity (and commutative addition)</h3>

I have a counterexample for these, but only a partial one; these ones are
<b>false for well-ordering</b>, but I haven't shown they're false for gaps.  The
problem is that the identity being two-sided rules out some of the dumb trickery
used in the previous case.<p>

Still, we can take the additive group to be an elementary abelian group of order
2<sup>k</sup>, take the example from the previous case, then adjoin a new
identity 1 that satisfies 1+1=0; we then again use the equation <b>ab=0</b>.  As
k increases, our probability here doesn't tend to 1, but does tend to &frac14;
from below, so reverse well-ordering is false.

<h3>Two-sided near-rings</h3>

Both the above examples rely on one-sided distributivity.  If you had a
two-sided near-ring -- so the only thing keeping it from being a rng was that
addition doesn't need to be commutative -- well... I think I have to call that
<b>plausible??</b>  Also, the 5/8 commuting law once again applies to these.<p>

(We could possibly generalize this to "group with one or more 'multilinear'
operations" attached...?)

<h3>Boolean rings</h3>

Finally, let's end this section with one more that's <b>true (including for the
compact case)</b>!  We can conclude that Boolean rings do indeed have a reverse
well-ordering law for the simple reason that they're equivalent to Boolean
algebras, which have a very restricted form.  Finite ones are necessarily powers
of the two-element Boolean algebra, which no matter the equation can only yield
probabilities of 0, &frac12;, and 1; so no matter the equation, you can only get
probabilities of the form 2<sup>-k</sup>.<p>

If I'm not mistaken, the infinite case is similar, only you'll get a probability
of 0 for equations that have a probability of 1/2 over {0, 1}.

<hr>
<h2>Lattice-like structures</h2>

<h3>Lattices, bounded lattices, semilattices</h3>

Let's start with your basic lattices and semilattices.  These fail to be
sink-resistant, and so are <b>false</b>.  Just take a lattice consisting of a
top element, a bottom element, and any number of incomparable middle elements.
We can then use <b>a&and;b=c&and;d</b>.

<h3>Boolean algebras</h3>

On the other hand, we've already seen that Boolean algebras are <b>true
(including for the compact case)</b>; the question now is, how much structure do
we need to get that?

<h3>Modular lattices, bounded modular lattices</h3>

Modular lattices aren't enough; our previous counterexample was already modular,
so these are <b>false</b>.

<h3>Distributive lattices</h3>

On the other hand, I haven't been able to find a counterexample for distributive
lattices... having to avoid that diamond sublattice lends these a bit of
sink-resistance, so I'm going to call these <b>plausible??</b>

<h3>Orthocomplemented lattices, orthomodular lattices</h3>

Now let's try adding complement operations.  But this by itself won't help; we
can take the same counterexample as before, make sure to use an even number of
elements in the middle layer, then pick an arbitrary orthocomplementation, still
using the equation <b>a&and;b=c&and;d</b>, ignoring the orthocomplementation
entirely.  These are <b>false</b>.<p>

Also, since this is example is modular, it is automatically also
orthomodular.<p>

Of course, an orthocomplemented distributive lattice would be a Boolean algebra,
and we know those are true.  But we can try distributivity with some weaker
complementation requirements...

<h3>Ockham algebras, De Morgan algebras</h3>

...like these!  These ones are still <b>false</b>, though.

For a De Morgan algebra counterexample, take the set {-n, -(n-1), ..., -1, 0,
0', 1, ..., n-1, n}, where 0 and 0' are incomparable, and let &not;a be the
unique order-reversing function with &not;0=0 and &not;0'=0'.<p>

We can then use the equation <b>a&and;&not;a&le;b&or;&not;b</b> (which I've
written as an inequality but obviously can be written as an equation) to get our
counterexample.<p>

These, in addition to the near-ring cases above, are a good example of how
adding an additional operation to a structure, allowing more expressive
equations, can change it from plausible to false, or true to false; we'll see
more of this shortly.

<h3>Kleene algebras (in the lattice theory sense)</h3>

But what if we make our complement requirements a little bit stronger, ruling
out the previous counterexample, while still not quite being a Boolean
algebra?<p>

Well, I don't know how to disprove a gap, but we can modifiy our previous
example to disprove well-ordering!  Just define &not;0=0' and &not;0'=0; then we
have a Kleene algera, and the probability of <b>a&le;&not;a</b> (which again can
also be written as an equation) is just under &frac12; approaching it from
below, showing that these are <b>false for well-ordering</b>.<p>

So, it looks like for complemented lattices, you may need the full power of a
Boolean algebra to get well-ordering.

<h3>Pseudocomplemented lattices, pseudocomplemented distributive lattices,
Stone algebras, Heyting algebras</h3>

OK, we've taken a look at the complemented world, but what about the
pseudocomplemented world?  Well, these are all <b>false</b>, even if you go all
the way to Heyting algebras.  The counterexample?  Just take a chain!  This will
be both a Heyting algebra and a Stone algebra.  (And the dual of both of these,
too!)<p>

Yeah, unlike complementation, pseudocomplementation lacks any sort of sink
resistance, so we can just use <b>&not;a=&not;b</b> as our counterexample.

<h3>Residuated lattices, residuated Boolean algebras</h3>

Adding this extra operation with so few requirements destroys the
sink-resistance that Boolean algebras have, so this is <b>false</b>.<p>

For our counterexample, we can take the Boolean algebra of subsets of a finite
set S, and define A&bull;B=A&cup;B if A&cap;B=&empty;, and A&bull;B=S otherwise.
Then of course we correspondingly take I=&empty;, and A/B is the set difference
A-B (I'm avoiding the backslash notation for obvious reasons here).  We can then
use the equation <b>a&bull;b=1</b>.<p>

(Note also this counterexample is commutative.)

<h3>Derivative algebras</h3>

Once again, the extra operation has no sink-resistance, so this is <b>false</b>.
Just define a<sup>D</sup>=1 if a&ne;0 and 0<sup>D</sup>=0; we can then use the
equation <b>a<sup>D</sup>=1</b>.

<h3>Relation algebras</h3>

One more example of Boolean algebras with extra structure, which are once again
<b>false</b>.  We can take the relation algebra of subsets of a finite group G,
and let G get arbitrarily large; then the inequality <b>I&le;a&bull;&abreve;</b>
(which, again, can also be written as an equation) provides our counterexample,
since it's satisfied by all elements except for 0 (the empty set).  Note that
because this inequality can be written as the equation a&bull;&abreve;&and;I=I,
this counterexample can be construed as a failure of sink-resistance.<p>

<h3>MV-algebras</h3>

I have no idea about these, but I couldn't find a counterexample, so this is
<b>???</b>

<hr>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>Median algebras</h3>

Once again, no sink-resistance means these are <b>false</b>.  Take the median
algebra of a star graph, and use the equation
<b>&lang;a,b,c&rang;=&lang;d,e,f&rang;</b>.

<h3>Left/right regular bands</h3>

These are already covered under semilattices and so are <b>false</b>.  I
wouldn't even include these, but they serve as a lead-in to the next entry...

<h3>Rectangular bands</h3>

...which I have to include, because this is a funny one -- this is another one
that has a really restricted form, with the result that it's <b>true (only the
finite case makes sense)</b> (I don't see how there could possibly be any form
of Haar measure here.)<p>

I view this as something of a red herring -- yeah, it's true, but I don't see
that telling us anything useful about what we really wanted to get at here.<p>

The restricted form these take means that any probability we get will be of the
form 1/n, so that gives us well-ordering, but... I can't see this as really
being relevant to anything we care about.
